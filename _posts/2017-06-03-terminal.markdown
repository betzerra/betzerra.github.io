Anything is better than macOS' default terminal. The white background and the way-too-small font are not a good fit for anyone. But hey! at least it's Windows' terminal, am I right?

Mine looks like this.

It's pretty basic but it's got what I need: 
- it's easy to read 
- it tells me in which git branch I am
- it has got emojis 😎

Here's what you need to know to setup yours:

- [Install iTerm2](http://iterm2.com)
- [Install oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
- [Install bullet-train theme](https://github.com/caiogondim/bullet-train.zsh)
- On __iTerm2 preferences__, under Profile -> Terminal, disable _"Show mark indicators"_.
- Use a custom palette, [here's mine]({{site.url}}/assets/betzerra.itermcolors).
- Get a font, mine is [13pt Droid Sans Mono Dotted for Powerline](https://github.com/powerline/fonts/blob/master/DroidSansMonoDotted).
- Customize oh-my-zsh theme by tweaking `~/.zshrc`. Here are some lines you might find relevant:

```
ZSH_THEME="bullet-train"

BULLETTRAIN_PROMPT_ORDER=(
  dir
  git
)

BULLETTRAIN_DIR_EXTENDED="0"
BULLETTRAIN_GIT_CLEAN=" 👌🏽 "
BULLETTRAIN_GIT_DIRTY=" 💩 "
BULLETTRAIN_GIT_UNTRACKED="%F{red} ★ %F{black}"
```
