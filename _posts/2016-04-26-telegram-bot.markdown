![Botzerra_bot working]({{site.url}}/assets/telegram_bot.png)

I liked [Telegram](https://telegram.org) since day 1 but after they released
their **bot API**, it became my favorite messaging app by far [^1].

So, because **I needed an excuse to learn Ruby** (and also because I needed this
pretty bad) I created [Botzerra_bot](http://telegram.me/botzerra_bot):
my personal bot that queries latest news from my favorite feeds (they're
mostly argentinian newspapers).

To use it, you just only have to look for **botzerra_bot** on Telegram (yeah,
like if you're searching for a contact). After that, you can send him `/start`
and follow the instructions for more information.

[^1]: Sorry Slack, you're great too but I only use you at work.
