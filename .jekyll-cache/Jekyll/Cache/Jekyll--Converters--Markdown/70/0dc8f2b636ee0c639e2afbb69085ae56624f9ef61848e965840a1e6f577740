I"Ù<p>Itâ€™s been more than a year since I talked about <a href="http://betzerra.github.io/jekyll/update/2016/04/26/telegram-bot.html">botzerra, my news bot</a>.
Back then, there was a lot of hype around bots. It was justfied, bots are awesome for several reasons: mostly because users donâ€™t need to download a new app (they donâ€™t need to login or sign up either). So I guess itâ€™s ok to say thereâ€™s less friction on bots than in apps, right?</p>

<p>Well, not quite. For some users, the idea of <em>an app inside your messaging app</em> was quite hard to grasp.
Also, after the novelty wore off I realized that having an app would be more attactive.</p>

<p>To start with, botâ€™s flow is way slower:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open Telegram.</li>
  <li>Look for News bot.</li>
  <li>Write <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/latest_news</code>.</li>
  <li>Send.</li>
</ol>

<p>Letâ€™s check same flow on an app:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open app.</li>
</ol>

<p>Boom.</p>

<p>In addition, apps can potencially look much better than bots.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bots focus on simple actions and content is key.</li>
  <li>Apps are more complex and focus on richer experiences.</li>
</ul>

<p>So I extracted the code from the bot and I made a <a href="https://github.com/Canillitapp/headlines-api">news API</a>.
After that, I created an <a href="https://twitter.com/betzerra/status/768816272192733184">Apple Watch client</a>, and many months later it became a whole <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/canillitapp/id1148447560?ls=1&amp;mt=8">iOS app</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://betzerra.github.io/assets/canillitapp_screenshot.png" alt="terminal screenshot" width="300px" /></p>

<p>My conclussion is that thereâ€™s no better platform than other. As many things in life, thereâ€™s always a trade off. If possible, try to think your app as a service and how could you adapt it on different use cases such as mobile apps, widgets, smartwatch apps, tv apps, bots, webapps and so on.</p>
