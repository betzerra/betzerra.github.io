I"Ã<p>Itâ€™s been more than a year since I talked about <a href="http://betzerra.github.io/jekyll/update/2016/04/26/telegram-bot.html">botzerra, my news bot</a>.
Back then, there was a lot of hype around bots. It was justfied, bots are awesome for several reasons: mostly because users donâ€™t need to download a new app (they donâ€™t need to login or sign up either). So I guess itâ€™s ok to say thereâ€™s less friction on bots than in apps, right?</p>
